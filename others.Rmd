# Some other analyses

Read more in [this PowerPoint presentation](other-files/Other_Post_GWAS_Analyses_SMARTBiomed 2025.pptx).

Here we just mention some other types of analyses that haven't really been covered in the course, but that are useful to know that they exist. We simply mention a few tools; you can find a list with more [here](https://github.com/MichelNivard/awesome-complex-trait-genetics).

- **Estimation of SNP-based heritability**: The proportion of phenotypic variance in a trait that can be explained by genetic variation captured by measured SNPs. A simple way to estimate it is with [LD Score regression (LDSC)](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Heritability-and-Genetic-Correlation) using GWAS summary statistics [@bulik2015ld]. R packages bigsnpr and GenomicSEM also provide some implementation of LDSC. There exist many other tools to estimate SNP-heritability, such as LDpred2-auto (mentioned before).

- **Genetic Correlation**: LDSC can be also used to estimate the genome-wide genetic correlation between two traits using GWAS summary statistics [@bulik2015atlas], and is also implemented in R package GenomicSEM. Local genetic correlations (e.g. within LD blocks) can also be estimated [@zhang2023benchmarking; @darlay2025exploring].

- **Partitioned heritability**: Heritability partitioned by functional annotation (which may be cell-type or state-specific), which can be estimated using [S-LDSC](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Partitioned-Heritability) [@finucane2015partitioning], [SumHer](https://dougspeed.com/heritability-enrichments/) [@speed2019sumher] and [SBayesRC](https://github.com/zhilizheng/SBayesRC) [@zheng2024leveraging].

- **Gene-based tests**: These determine the genes associated with a trait from a GWAS by using proximity, such as mBAT-combo as an [R package](https://github.com/Share-AL-work/mBAT.combo) or a [command-line software](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#mBAT-combo) [@li2023mbat].

- **Summary statistic imputation**: imputation of GWAS summary statistics help increase the SNP overlap between GWAS summary statistics and LD reference panels.

- **Meta-analysis of GWAS**:
  - same trait, different cohorts: [METAL](https://github.com/statgen/METAL) [@willer2010metal]
  - multiple traits: [MTAG](https://github.com/JonJala/mtag) [@turley2018multi]
  - multiple ancestries: [MR-MEGA](https://genomics.ut.ee/en/tools) [@magi2017trans]

- **Colocalisation**: The same variant may be significant for two traits, but not necessarily be causal for both. Tools like [COLOC + SuSiE](https://chr1swallace.github.io/coloc/articles/a06_SuSiE.html) directly assess this, yielding probabilities the signal is driven by the same variant, or two different variants [@wallace2021more]. [SMR](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr/#SMR&HEIDIanalysis) is a complementary approach designed for testing if a molQTL is also a causal variant for a trait, yielding an association statistic [@zhu2016integration].

- **Gene expression signature of a trait**: Use GWAS summary stats with eQTL/gene expression data. Early tools include [FUSION](https://github.com/gusevlab/fusion_twas) [@gusev2016integrative] and [PrediXcan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan) [@gamazon2015gene], although many more have been developed since.

- **Structural Equation Modelling**: [GenomicSEM](https://github.com/GenomicSEM/GenomicSEM/wiki) is a tool for structural equation modelling of GWAS summary statistics, allowing you to model the relationships between traits using their genetic architecture [@grotzinger2019genomic].
